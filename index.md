## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

### Multi-label Text Classification Research

Applied deep learning algorithm and machine learning algorithm to conduct multi-label classification of senior high school questions by subject and successfully meet the benchmark.

Used TFIDF and Word2Vec to preprocess the raw data, applied CNN, Char-CNN, RF and SVM to process multi-label text classification; found efficiency of this method lacking 

Improved classification precision while maintaining the same level of recall with hierarchical attention networks, which excavated more hierarchical features and sequential information.

Developed algorithm by using ensemble methods to refine representation learning and found a creative solution to the model’s heavy workload with gcForest achieving the state-of-the-art F-score.

### Hate Speech Detection with Deep Learning Algorithm

This research is inspired by Analysis of Hate Speech in Social Media, conducted by UCSB NLP Group

Designed a searching pipeline module with python to collect data stream on social media and store on local server, used XXX to build Chinese and English dataset  

Studied domestic and foreign literature, integrated the very deep convolutional neural network with a block attention module to build and train the detection model and overcome the challenges of the variety of platforms that incubate hate speech other than Twitter and the need to move beyond keyword-based methods that have been shown to miss many instances of hateful speech 

Tested the approach and f1-score in English corpus increased by 7 percentage points and a rise of 3 percentage point in Chinese corpus

### Document Search Robot Development Using Amazon Lex and Amazon Elasticsearch Services


Attended a two-week training from AWSEducation, learned about AI services, image recognition technology, and architecture technology with 20 experiments

Built a document search robot using Amazon Lex and Amazon Elasticsearch services

Completed upload service, used cloudformation stack to establish AmazonS3 bucket and two colonies of Elasticsearch, used the AWSLambda function and related IAM characters to visit bucket

Built search robot by importing default template in Lex, integrated Web UI by using identity pools of Cognito to receive temporary credentials, and used cloudFront for online deployment


### Chengdu ACTi Technology & Development Co., Ltd



Rotated from assembly line work to module development, fulfilled customers’ demands by designing electronic circuits and conducting performance tests

Solved a research dilemma within half a day by proactively organizing a special team to gather people involved in the entire production process

Developed a sorting machine to solve the problem of mixed screws on the production line to improve work efficiency

### Constructing Topical Concept Taxonomy with Adaptive Local Embedding and Clustering

Applied non-negative matrix factorization and hierarchical clustering to construct a topical taxonomy in a recursive fashion

Built a hierarchical co-clustering module by using non-negative matrix tri-factorization for allocating attractions and things of interest to topics when splitting coarse topics into fine-grained ones

Established a concept extraction module for extracting concepts for every topic which maintains strong discriminative power at different levels of the taxonomy

Devised new topical taxonomy approach by constructing a smallest spanning tree with a greedy heurist algorithm
